## 🎯 Project Intention

This is an analytics engineering project using open-source Airbnb data from various cities across the globe. 🌍

The goal is to:
- 🧼 **Ingest, clean, and standardize** Airbnb listing data across multiple locations
- 🧠 **Model data** using dbt to enable meaningful insights on listings, hosts, and trends
- 📊 **Build reporting dashboards** using Looker Studio to visualize trends and performance
- 🧪 Showcase **Analytics Engineering best practices** using modern tools
